# KAAVS: Kind Of Automatic Audio to Video Synchronizer

The KAAVS project is an attempt to simplify the life of an average aviation YouTuber who records vidoes in the cockpit and struggles with synchronizing audio and video streams from various devices.
The solution comprises of two parts:

- A device with an audio output, that can be connected to an audio recorder
- A command-line tool that processes the recorded audio and splits it into parts

## How this works

The idea is to use the device for generating a synchronization tone.
The tone should be recorded on a digital audio recorder at the start of every scene.
Then the command-line tool can be used to cut the audio file into scenes.
Video content can then be aligned to the audio clips.
This should be relativelly easy if the user makes sure the KAAVS device is visible on the video recordings when it is activated.

## Prerequisites

1. Install ffmpeg (essentials). You can find the most recent build of FFMPEG [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/). The "essentials" is enough.

2. Install SciPy. If you don't have Python yet, go to the [Python downloads site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and get it. You need the 3.x version, not the 2.x Then invoke:
    `python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy nose` to install the required libraries.

## Device

The device is very simple. It's built around ATTiny13 microcontroller.  
![Device schema](https://github.com/insightmachineslab/kaavs/schema.png "Device schema")
The controller generates a tone using an Arduino library. It is powered by a 3V coin battery.
A button at the top of the device closes the circuit and turns on the ATTiny13 and two red LEDs.
A 3.5 mm audio socket, at the bottom of the device, allows connecting to a recording device with an audio cable.

## Command-line Tool

The command-line tool can be used to automaticall split the recordings into "scenes", where each scene starts with a tone generated by the device.
The tool is written in Python
